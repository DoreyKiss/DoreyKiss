## 🦊  Welcome to My GitHub! 👋

I'm **Dory**, an inquisitive 🧪 SDET with a taste for breaking things (mostly on purpose) and building smarter tests to catch bugs before users do.

- 🌱 Currently sharpening my skills in **automation, CI/CD pipelines, and performance testing**
- 🛠️ Looking to collaborate on **challenging test automation projects** or **open source tools**
- 🎯 Always chasing edge cases, elusive bugs, and elegant test frameworks
- 🦊 Fun fact: Foxes don’t follow paths — they make their own. Just like my test scripts.
- 🤠 Weird fact: My favorite ohmyzsh plugin is [chuck_cow](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/blob/master/plugins/chucknorris/README.md) — because random Chuck cows are always chuckling in my shell.
